<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resume Generator requires access to certain scopes to work. Documents scope will be used to access current active document which is the Resume Template. Drive read-only scope will be used to select Experiences Database spreadsheet from Google Drive using Google Picker. Script Container UI scope will be used to display UI alerts when the ExperiencesDB spreadsheet is not selected or when the spreadsheet is no longer valid (such as when it has been deleted by the user). Spreadsheets scope will be used to read data from the Experience DB spreadsheet. Additionally, Resume Generator uses the Google Apps Script Properties service to cache the ExperienceDB spreadsheet id so that users do not have to reselect the spreadsheet each time they close and reopen open Google Docs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Keep in mind that Google has a daily cap on the number of times you can run the add-on.

<h2>Skill Matching Algorithm</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two regular expressions are used to match skills in the job description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first one /(?&lt;=\W)[A-Z][\+#]*(?=$|\W)/g. It says to match a single letter followed by zero or more pluses or sharps. This is targets skills such as R, C++, and C#.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second one is /(?&lt;!(^|\. ))(?&lt;=\W)(\w?[A-Z]\w+ ?)+/g;. It matches one or more words that start with a capital letter such as Golang, MySQL, or "Manufacturing Engineering". It also matches if the first letter is lowercase followed by a capital letter such as jQuery. It does not match if the word starts a new line or begins a sentence. For example it will not match Ideal, Excellent, Knows, and Demonstrates in <br>
Ideal candidate qualities:<br>
Excellent communication skills. Knows grammar.<br>
Demonstrates willingness to learn.</p>
